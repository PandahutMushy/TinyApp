# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). This web application is a functional prototype using a simple controller and router architecture, fully supporting the eventual implementation of MVC.

## Features:
- User registration and authentication
- Session management using encrypted cookies
- Users can add, update, and delete the short URLs they have created
- Users must be logged in to add, update, or delete their short URLs
- Minimalist, fully responsive bootstrap elements, suitable as a skeleton for any project design
